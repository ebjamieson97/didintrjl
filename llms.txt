# didintrjl

## Overview

**didintrjl** is an R wrapper for the Julia package
[DiDInt.jl](https://ebjamieson97.github.io/DiDInt.jl/dev/), which
implements intersection difference-in-differences (DID-INT), a method
developed by [Karim & Webb (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14447).
DID-INT allows for unbiased estimation of the average effect of
treatment on the treated (ATT) in cases when the common causal
covariates (CCC) assumption is violated.
